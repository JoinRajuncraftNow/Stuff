#Who visited my Mathematical-Programming repo?
#What is Pet.cpp, I think that you may need to use threading to have multiple processes running at the same time!
$ Organized. Boom.
#Did you use a batch file?
@I like the organization, and it's a cool idea to have a pet in your game.  
@I'm learning a new language for my Maryville Matters because the language has a framework that will really help me now and in the future
@Hopefully, I'll have an instant messaging app that everyone can get on and post memes and stuff for my Maryville Matters.
#BAD IDEA (probably filled with defacing Harness)
$ I agree with Zachary on that. I was going to add the pet into my hardcore version but now I might make it a standalone tamagotchi sorta thing. 
# (Insert Harness Meme Here)
# Who is porgull, is it Connor Barker???
$ It is Connor Barker. 
#Thanks for the credit!
@That's the point. I want people to post memes and stuff while I'm presenting. That way, my presentation will be funny and people will like it. 
@And it will be on the board, so people won't put super innopropriate stuff on there
