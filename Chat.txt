# PY IS COMMAND LINE BASED, SO IMMEDIATE (it acts as a calculator)
# And you can have powershell do the exact same thing. (just use .\mingw.exe ... when you are in the directory of mingw)
# So mingw can work with powershell!!!
$ K Thanks.
# We should get Connor Barker and Garrett Smith on GitHub (good at C++ and JavaScript, respectively)
$ Connor is not interested. I am starting on my maryville matters, to make a text adventure with C++. XD
# If needed, I'll try to get Garrett Smith (probably not, he'll never have time)
# Tell me if you need help on it!
# (post it on github, I may help correct any typos and useless things)
